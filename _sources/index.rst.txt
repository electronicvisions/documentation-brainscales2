BrainScaleS-2 User Documentation
================================

We use sphinx to build a comprehensive document comprising three main
components:

* :doc:`Demos & Examples <brainscales2-demos/index>` providing an introduction to the system and its usage,
* :doc:`user documentation for the software APIs <userdoc_repos>`,
* and :doc:`API documentation <apis>` generated from in-code comments

Our sphinx setup supports both, ReSTructured text as well as markdown.
The [API documentation](apis) is generated via doxygen and breathe.
